Short bio＃
I am a street photographer because I love capturing the subtle elements of the human condition. I look for ※the clickpoint,§ the visceral moment that reflects the poetry, irony, sadness or humor of life, inviting viewers to seek out a narrative thread that lends perspective to how people interact with each other and their surroundings. My work is candid, intuitive and spontaneous; no shots are posed or altered in post production. What you see is what I saw and felt when I released the shutter.
You shoot film because＃
I like the tonal subtlety, richness, depth and realistic ※feel§ of film; I shoot mostly black and white, and to me there is nothing more pleasing than a gelatin silver print taken from the original negative. ※Digital capture§ is a game of playing with ※ones and zeros§ and the results can be unauthentic, brittle and overly manipulated. Film photography, on the other hand, is the discipline of putting light on celluloid and then paper, and that is what true photographic art has always been.
Your photography feels like＃
a freeze-frame from a movie on the absurdity and beauty found in everyday, human moments: the implications of simple gestures made, poses struck, emotions expressed. Some film noir mixed with cinema verite and farce, my work strives to elicit a spark of recognition or bemusement from the viewer, who might realize I have frozen a moment that conveys what they themselves may be feeling or have felt.

Analog requires me to commit to the process and to make creative decisions. In other photography mediums, you don＊t have to really put as much photo and make a firm commitment as you can take 200 and hope 1 turns out, or spend hours fixing and making it right on a computer. With film, you have to be technically and artistically perfect and a quite lucky. I like the effort, work, and also being able to make my own output starting from exposing light on the film to making a final print in a darkroom.
Your photography feels like＃
One of my favorite films is ※Paris, Texas§ by Wim Wenders. The film isn＊t high impact at first watch, but builds up and the imagery becomes more apparent after spending some time with it. I would hope that my photography is a mix of what I am personally drawn to and I aspire that it even has a small glimmer of the subtle imagery, underlying emotions, and bleak landscape that the film has.

Short bio＃
As a child, I was fascinated by my mother＊s family album which had been effaced by typhoons; images of people and places peeled away, exposing the white surface of the paper. To me, the white paper suggested undefined spaces in which anything could take place. Through my own photographs, I am driven to create imagined worlds within spaces that have been destroyed.

The tactile process is much more intuitive to me. I studied fiber art in school and learned to appreciate hands-on and time-based techniques, which translated directly into my darkroom practice. Being in the darkroom also brings me a deep sense of calm and purpose.

You shoot film because＃ it forces me to slow down, and really look.

The ritual when working with film suits my way of working. It allows me to focus more on my concept and what the image should have in the end. This way I can put my precision skills into practice and carefully work on an image. The process empties my mind and slows me down. It＊s like meditation for me.
Your photography feels like＃ 
The work mainly focuses on space that we find difficult to relate to. These spaces seem disconnected and uninviting; they lack a sense of humanism and warmth. What we are left with is a space that is empty and timeless. The emptiness becomes a quality of the space itself, emphasized by its specific aesthetics. I try to capture this by visualising this disconnection. What elements provoke these feelings of disconnection? Is it the used materials? Is it the colour use of the space or Is it the shape of the space? These questions I try to research in my work.

A lot of my work is about the interaction I have with people. Along with the size of my camera the fact it is made of wood is always a starting point for when I make pictures of people. It allows us to both experience something new. Shooting large format also enables me to really stare at a persons eyes before I take the picture. Something both them and I would be uncomfortable with using any other medium.

I was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. I have always been interested in the visual arts, and in 2008, while doing my undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia, I started to seriously consider photography as a means of communication.
You shoot film because...
I find the aesthetics of film far more pleasing. The colours are deeper, the tones are more present and gradual. I like how the process is slower, enduring, more tactile, and requires accuracy and careful foresight; it harmonizes with the experience of making a photograph.This allows me to connect with my subject in a more meaningful way, which I believe is important in creating a narrative. There＊s also a lot of detail and information in a large film negative, and it really invites the viewer to study the photograph.
Your photography feels like＃
Precise and pensive. At the moment, my aforementioned approach to shooting film largely influences the subject matter I choose to photograph. As a result, I＊m drawn to things that allow me the time and space to connect with my subject.

I make pictures on film because film photos are more emotional and warm for me than digital. Digital photos, for me, are too cold, sterile and unnatural. All of the photographs that are on my website are done with film. Also, colours from tape is much closer to me than digital. For personal exhibitions, I print my own pictures using my own hands, on old silver gelatin paper in a 60 x 50 cm format.

It is a physical material holding the record of light and time, which it is intrinsic to the ideas within Collage on Film; bringing together disparate moments on to the surface of one frame of film as one record. I also shoot on film for it reveals and makes apparent the subtle, rich qualities of light, colour and forms in existence (more than digital could achieve). And because film when processed sometimes shows unexpected results, allowing mistakes and experiments to take a life of their own.

To depict the ※American Dream,§ I have wandered through amusement parks, parade grounds, beaches, and boardwalks. While sometimes a participant at these venues, I have strived to maintain the role of an outsider. Recording a broken Ferris Wheel or kids in front of an ice cream stand render a timeless quality.

In 2008 during my second year at RISD, the school had decided to get rid of their color photography program. They felt that with the trend of photo-labs closing down, they didn＊t see the purpose in teaching students a medium that would discontinue. They ended up giving me the equipment, I set up a color darkroom in the basement of a mill building. I began making experimental C-Prints and working with Wet Plate Collodion. I feel that working in the darkroom is magical and meditative.

Vision, camera movements lead the view into the image with the softness felt by our own eyes. Skin becomes metallic, and the slow nature of working in the darkroom takes on a meditative quality. The portraits are of friends and couples, who sit for me. They are not meant to be over the top images, I seek a simple intimacy in the photographs. I aim for the images to take on the same meditative state that the process offers me in the darkroom, a simple beauty, a quiet intimacy.

I prefer the comparative slowness of the process and the greater degree of control over and care of the subject matter within the image making process.

When I took my first pictures it was on film and it didn＊t take much time from that moment to find myself in my own darkroom. Developing and printing was an important part of the whole photographic process. The standard and industrial processes may have changed, the most important part for an intimate portrait is how I approach a situation as a photographer. And that did not change. I have to let go control in some regards, and the best way for me to do so is to trust in what I am able to do.

For me it feels like I am back in the situation a photograph was taken. Perfect. It is a very deep sensation in many cases. Also I am listening to music a lot when I work and music inspires me a lot, so for me there is music in my pictures as well. I heard several times that people found my photography cinematographic and in some cases I see the point though there was never an intention behind that.

The main thing I love about film is that each picture is like a little present 每 a surprise. You never quite know how it will turn out. When I shoot Polaroid, even the smallest change in light can have a huge difference, and the temperature of where I shoot, or how I ※nurse§ the picture while developing can all cause massive changes. With expired film, the picture is only half yours, and the rest belongs to fate. I like the physicality of it and room for experimentation. I embrace failures!

My Polaroids fall into two categories 每 ※straight§ Polaroids (unedited, unmanipulated on expired film), or emulsion lifts (shown here).

The mystery and the wonder that lays behind shooting analogue is one that is rewarding. The act of shooting something (regardless of whether or not you have an actual ＆plan＊) and not having any idea of what exactly it is you＊ll see after development. Film is a constant learning process. Analogue does not give you the instant results which today＊s technologies do 每 it reminds us that time exists and sometimes we must wait for or work for a desirable end product.

I＊m still using film and darkroom not just because I love and want to preserve the medium, but because anticipation is inherent in the analog film process. The latent image that exists on the unprocessed film, and the wait in the darkroom for the image to appear are natural extensions of the theme of anticipation in my work. The monochrome palette furthers the idea of a glimpse into possibility by reduction to shapes and symbols.

I like the way in which film shapes my personal approach to photography, how it causes me to carefully consider each frame, knowing I only have 12. It slows me down, needs my full attention, and forces me to really focus on that moment, not worried yet about what comes next.

To create images on film requires real presence; something tangible must exist in front of the camera for the picture to be made. Film photography requires chemistry for the alchemic cycle to be completed and for the image to be fixed permanently on the substrate. Yet, even with all of this absoluteness, the photographs themselves are shifting interpretations每 fragments that form beautiful works of fiction. What remains for us to see is a beautiful paradox每 a quantum reflection of vision.

I take photos with a film as it is a magical process. Digital camera is too easy to use. This advantage turns into a serious disadvantage. You just start taking too many pictures. You stop thinking.

In this work, I discuss the absence of the child who is no longer one. It is then more narrative or autobiography but individual plots made ??available and who speaks more than one thing: change, transition: the definition of a before and an after, a time that you want to suspend, something intangible, the intimacy of a memory. The images were taken with a Fuji Instax. This choice reflects the desire for a form of letting go but also the difficulty of a clear statement of feelings.

Shooting film is the only way I have found to create an accurate depiction of the concepts I want to portray. Film photography sits between reality and representation, not quite aligning with but still representing the real. It adds a beautiful mystery to the process of taking photographs, with the creation of the image and the existence of its physical manifestation separated by time. There is nothing quite like great art; its magic is demonstrated and preserved by film photography.
Your photography feels like＃
A combination between Irving Penn and Arnaud Maggs, but feminized. A less clinical Rineke Djikstra. Dutch Golden Age paintings, made photographic. I derive inspiration from so many aspects of life that my art is a convoluted version of everything I engage with. Dreams, memory, and my never-ending fascination with beauty all play a role in my art creation. At its best, my photography feels like an intimate moment through my eyes, a representation of how I conceptualize the world.

Fort Worth Texas is where I was born, raised and continue to live with my wife and daughter. It was my great fortune in life to be born into an artistic family. My dad was an artist and professor of art and my mom was quite accomplished in multiple mediums as well. Though I studied Architecture in school I don＊t make my living by it. It does, however, often guide me in terms of subject matter. The natural world is my other primary focus. Of course there＊s my daughter, but that＊s different.

Film＊s ※limitations§ are important to me. They require thought, patience and a freaking clue as to what you/it are doing. Working with film is, for want of another word, meditative. It＊s slow-er.

Short bio＃
Born and raised in Budapest, I did my university studies in Barcelona, Tel Aviv and London, where I am based now. Throughout my artistic practice, my main interest has been the psychological landscape of the urban life from a human and architectural point of view. I begin by observing and photographing my environment. I make videos, sound recordings, architectural models and then start to speculate on their possible changes. ?But the process?always starts with photography.
You shoot film because＃ I like everything about it more; the sound how the camera shoots, the smell of the film, the aesthetics of the cameras, changing the film, the guy in the shop where I develop my films＃.. and of course the texture of the resultant images.

I like the whole process of analog photography. I like the smell and the noise and knowing there is a limit of photos in one roll makes me carefully consider each frame. To focus what I want to photograph. It is really sharpening my flair of the composition of photography.

Quote of a good friend Eva Sophie: ※With his contemporary photographs he captures moods of light and shadow. Places of silence and darkness are revealed through the light of the lens. Simplicity, solitude, and melancholy calmly refer to the contrary of the fast life. The photos are special in terms of composition, harmonious colors and interesting appearance. The photos look at ease and unconstrained, and enable a glimpse of the world through his eyes.§.

I am a Scottish artist working with lens-based media, principally as an analogue photographer concentrating on wet-plate collodion and film technology and as a filmmaker combining digital video and hand-developed 8mm and 16mm film-stock. I trained at the Glasgow School of Art then fled the country, returning after a dutiful spell in London and a more relaxed time in Amsterdam; I now live in Edinburgh. My work is rooted in place and the intrinsic connections between people, land and sea.

I always have. I was taken into the darkrooms at the Glasgow School of Art by my tutor in 1988. I have hand developed film and printed since then. It is part of my armoury as an artist.The work I have sent you is wet plate work, part of McArthur＊s Store documentary project, a three year project (now in its second year) documenting the fishing community in Dunbar, a small town on the Eastern seaboard of Scotland. The project is being made using wet plate collodion, pinhole, 120 and 35mm film.

The McArthur＊s Store is a building from 1658 inhabited only by fishermen; wet plate collodion was originally chosen to compliment the film. There is an archive of early photography in Scotland recording the fishing industry: collodion has a way with peoples eyes and I decided not to record the men in action but to catch them being still, to use portraiture to slow them down, to quieten the noise of the harbour. Also, these tintypes were made within McArthur＊s Store, in their environment.

You shoot film because＃
The most important to me as an artist about film is its materiality. Not only am I working with a machine that is capable of record whatever is in front of the lens, but I am also granted the opportunity to work with this wonderful complex and diverse light-sensitive material. In my work I push film＊s inherent range to its limits, working in a space that lends for the materiality of the medium itself to create the surreal within reality and challenge expectations of what a photograph does.
Your photography feels like＃
My work feels like magic realism unfolding in the monotony of Midwestern American suburbia. I draw inspiration from the films of David Lynch and John Carpenter and their focus on the absurd and horrific set against the safety of the suburbs. The photographs I make heavily reference dreams and/or memories and are taken directly from my own personal childhood experiences. I am interested in the way memory recollection is distorted and the surreal quality they take on as we grow older.

I started taking pictures with my Vivitar 110 of my friends in the neighborhood. When I was 14, one of my photographs was selected to tour the state in a 4-H Club traveling exhibit. In college I only took one photography class, and spent many years as a skilled beginner. Last year I had the opportunity to go back to school where I am focusing on visual arts. Last semester I began making self portraits which developed into a theme which expanded across all of my classes.

I have always enjoys film and the suspense in waiting for film to be developed. Several years ago I started collecting vintage and antique cameras which turned into more of a rescue project. I seek out all formats of film, cameras and darkroom equipment in order to preserve the medium. I believe that the skills and passion that one puts into creating an image using any of the analog techniques gives the piece an aura that digital can only duplicate.

Currently I am working on personal projects, commissions and exhibitions prior to applying for an MFA.
You shoot film because＃
It provides me with a physical connection to the medium, allowing for the control of subtleties that I appreciate, therefore the darkroom is integral to my working processes. I mainly work in black and white, as I value it＊s reductive abilities, and the manner in which it enables me to use light as a tool whilst shooting and printing. I firmly believe that using film, (especially larger formats with a technical camera), gives me the ability to express my ideas and interests most fluently.
Your photography feels like＃
To me it feels like an intense studying, where an object has been isolated and changed (or elevated), allowing it to speak for more than itself. What appears in the images is determined by both ideas and aesthetics, so I aim for the objects in my photographs to be read like excerpts from a text. In this way I could say it is analogous to literature or poetry, working at night is therefore a device used to transform the subject, so it can express feelings and ideas I help to determine.

You shoot film because＃
I have been working with film since my first days in photography and it is a medium I am most confident with. In my projects I often photograph everyday and ordinary things that require my mind and eyes to work constantly, looking for something unapparent but valuable enough to become an image. It enforced a certain patience and, therefore, film photography, which requires much more deliberate decisions, for me is the most appropriate way of working.

I work in all mediums. I choose the process I work in for how it marries to the idea I am trying to express. The body of work Point of Origin is emotive and filled with memory. I use an 8℅10 view camera because it slows me down and creates an image that feels grounded and present. I use film for my b&w work because digital images feel very different＃ cold and processed. This work is about my family. Touching, embracing and sometimes fighting with prints while in the act of making them just feels right.

From the first moment of photography, I started to shoot in film. To me, film shooting is more about photography itself.

My photography is like short writing or poem about space and time in between me and my object. I feel like to create one map about my theme. Every images are pieces of big puzzle. I quest and sniff in exploring my photographing behavior. I am very excited and wondered to encounter the last scene of my project as an accomplished map. It＊s more like everyday life＊s journal. Journal can be humble and banal. But it can be history with accumulation of time.
