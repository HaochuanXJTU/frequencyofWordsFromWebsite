jim-lustenader-bonita-springs-fl-usa
Short bio¡­
I am a street photographer because I love capturing the subtle elements of the human condition. I look for ¡°the clickpoint,¡± the visceral moment that reflects the poetry, irony, sadness or humor of life, inviting viewers to seek out a narrative thread that lends perspective to how people interact with each other and their surroundings. My work is candid, intuitive and spontaneous; no shots are posed or altered in post production. What you see is what I saw and felt when I released the shutter.
You shoot film because¡­
I like the tonal subtlety, richness, depth and realistic ¡°feel¡± of film; I shoot mostly black and white, and to me there is nothing more pleasing than a gelatin silver print taken from the original negative. ¡°Digital capture¡± is a game of playing with ¡°ones and zeros¡± and the results can be unauthentic, brittle and overly manipulated. Film photography, on the other hand, is the discipline of putting light on celluloid and then paper, and that is what true photographic art has always been.
Your photography feels like¡­
a freeze-frame from a movie on the absurdity and beauty found in everyday, human moments: the implications of simple gestures made, poses struck, emotions expressed. Some film noir mixed with cinema verite and farce, my work strives to elicit a spark of recognition or bemusement from the viewer, who might realize I have frozen a moment that conveys what they themselves may be feeling or have felt.

You shoot film because¡­
Analog requires me to commit to the process and to make creative decisions. In other photography mediums, you don¡¯t have to really put as much photo and make a firm commitment as you can take 200 and hope 1 turns out, or spend hours fixing and making it right on a computer. With film, you have to be technically and artistically perfect and a quite lucky. I like the effort, work, and also being able to make my own output starting from exposing light on the film to making a final print in a darkroom.
Your photography feels like¡­
One of my favorite films is ¡°Paris, Texas¡± by Wim Wenders. The film isn¡¯t high impact at first watch, but builds up and the imagery becomes more apparent after spending some time with it. I would hope that my photography is a mix of what I am personally drawn to and I aspire that it even has a small glimmer of the subtle imagery, underlying emotions, and bleak landscape that the film has.

Short bio¡­
As a child, I was fascinated by my mother¡¯s family album which had been effaced by typhoons; images of people and places peeled away, exposing the white surface of the paper. To me, the white paper suggested undefined spaces in which anything could take place. Through my own photographs, I am driven to create imagined worlds within spaces that have been destroyed.
You shoot film because¡­
The tactile process is much more intuitive to me. I studied fiber art in school and learned to appreciate hands-on and time-based techniques, which translated directly into my darkroom practice. Being in the darkroom also brings me a deep sense of calm and purpose.

You shoot film because¡­ it forces me to slow down, and really look. There is something very precious about capturing an image on film that is not paralleled in any other medium¡­ something special about the limited number of shots, having a solid object and the hours or days of anticipation to see what images will emerge.
Your photography feels like¡­ shared memories. Experiences we can all relate to, familiar and foreign, that make us reconsider what we know.

You shoot film because¡­
The ritual when working with film suits my way of working. It allows me to focus more on my concept and what the image should have in the end. This way I can put my precision skills into practice and carefully work on an image. The process empties my mind and slows me down. It¡¯s like meditation for me.
Your photography feels like¡­ 
The work mainly focuses on space that we find difficult to relate to. These spaces seem disconnected and uninviting; they lack a sense of humanism and warmth. What we are left with is a space that is empty and timeless. The emptiness becomes a quality of the space itself, emphasized by its specific aesthetics. I try to capture this by visualising this disconnection. What elements provoke these feelings of disconnection? Is it the used materials? Is it the colour use of the space or Is it the shape of the space? These questions I try to research in my work.

I¡¯m a Welsh photographer based in Brighton. I¡¯ve recently finished studying BA (hons) Documentary Photography in Newport. My academic year marked the 100th year of Photography being studied at Newport. My work focuses on more conceptual subject matter and is often presented in form by using large format photography (10¡Á8) and self-published books. Since graduating I¡¯ve contributed to FT Magazine, Oftheafternoon, BJP and the photography lecture series Miniclick.
You should film because¡­
I shoot on film because it allows me to create something physical. It also allows me to work slowly which is a novelty in the modern day.
Your photography feels like¡­
A lot of my work is about the interaction I have with people. Along with the size of my camera the fact it is made of wood is always a starting point for when I make pictures of people. It allows us to both experience something new. Shooting large format also enables me to really stare at a persons eyes before I take the picture. Something both them and I would be uncomfortable with using any other medium.

Short bio¡­
I was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. I have always been interested in the visual arts, and in 2008, while doing my undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia, I started to seriously consider photography as a means of communication.
You shoot film because...
I find the aesthetics of film far more pleasing. The colours are deeper, the tones are more present and gradual. I like how the process is slower, enduring, more tactile, and requires accuracy and careful foresight; it harmonizes with the experience of making a photograph.This allows me to connect with my subject in a more meaningful way, which I believe is important in creating a narrative. There¡¯s also a lot of detail and information in a large film negative, and it really invites the viewer to study the photograph.
Your photography feels like¡­
Precise and pensive. At the moment, my aforementioned approach to shooting film largely influences the subject matter I choose to photograph. As a result, I¡¯m drawn to things that allow me the time and space to connect with my subject.

I was born on 5th of November 1981, in Alytus, Lithuania. I am general film photographer. I also do short films, paint and design sculptures. I have been professing photography since 1999. In 2005 I graduated studies of Photography Technologies at Vilnius College of design. In the year 2009, during the international exhibition ¡°Madamorfozes¡± I was given the title of the best amateur fashion photographer. Since 2012 I have been a member of the Union of the Lithuanian art photographers.
You shoot film because¡­
I make pictures on film because film photos are more emotional and warm for me than digital. Digital photos, for me, are too cold, sterile and unnatural. All of the photographs that are on my website are done with film. Also, colours from tape is much closer to me than digital. For personal exhibitions, I print my own pictures using my own hands, on old silver gelatin paper in a 60 x 50 cm format.

I love to take portraits with my Rolleiflex and my favorite films include the expired Kodak Portra, Kodak ELITE Chrome and all Ilford films.
You shoot film because¡­
I feel my images are more pure and simple. I don¡¯t need all the different settings that are available in digital cameras to create a photo. Film cameras help me when taking street portraits as people are more accepting of an old film camera than a DSLR.

You shoot film because¡­
I always like process which is not involved with digital technologies. That¡¯s why I prefer to develop films by myself and making prints in darkroom. Also I think that print is always better if author make it by himself, artwork is complete if all the steps are made by author, so I often use alternative printing techniques ¨C cyanotype, lith-print, gumpigment process, in this processes author can put his additional creativity to final tangible incarnation of image. And sorry my english!

Alexandra Hughes¡¯s practice explores photographic processes and materials, examining thresholds of time and place. Collage on Film (2012) is created through analogue photography. The photographs are captured through handmade masks placed inside the camera body, between the lens and film. Hughes (b.1982 Canada) is based in the UK. Hughes completed her MFA at Slade School of Fine Art, UK (2008), and her BA Hons Photography at University College Falmouth, UK (2004) and has exhibited widely.
You shoot film because¡­.
It is a physical material holding the record of light and time, which it is intrinsic to the ideas within Collage on Film; bringing together disparate moments on to the surface of one frame of film as one record. I also shoot on film for it reveals and makes apparent the subtle, rich qualities of light, colour and forms in existence (more than digital could achieve). And because film when processed sometimes shows unexpected results, allowing mistakes and experiments to take a life of their own.
Your photography feels like¡­
Contemplations. I can draw a relationship to Haiku poetry, through the attempt to chronicle the essence of a moment in which nature is linked to human life. Creating a feeling and contemplation for the tension between universal elements, such as movement and stillness, change and continuance, time and timelessness, nature and humanity.
gene-hollander-buffalo-grove-il-usa
Short bio¡­
For over thirty years, I have explored the unique qualities of black and white infrared film. I found myself being continually drawn to the art deco and yesteryear feel of the images. To depict the ¡°American Dream,¡± I have wandered through amusement parks, parade grounds, beaches, and boardwalks. While sometimes a participant at these venues, I have strived to maintain the role of an outsider. Recording a broken Ferris Wheel or kids in front of an ice cream stand render a timeless quality.
You shoot film because¡­
It lends itself to the images I shoot, and from a technical standpoint, it provides the halation that digital photography cannot deliver.

Currently he¡¯s focused on 6¡Á6 black&white photography and working with Kiev 88, Hasselblad 501CM, Kodak Duaflex II, Holga and homemade cameras. Landscapes, waterscapes, cityscapes, even melancholic dreamscapes ¨C are the main fields of his interest.
You shoot film because¡­
I prefer film photography not only because the film smells funny. I found the analog photography is much more fragile and subtle. There are a lot of chances for fault. And when you get what you expected ¨C it¡¯s a unique feeling. Film is able to reflect more properly the visions that appear sometimes.
Your photography feels like¡­
My photographs are my way to show and express some of my feelings and my personal perception of what surrounds us. Having my mind, eyes and camera I am going downward the maze of visions and do not care if entering the room, where someone has just been or from which I just gone. But there¡¯s no denying ¨C someday I¡¯d love to get into the room where no one has gone before.

Brett¡¯s passion of photography is based strongly in the craft and alchemy of the process, from the dying art of C-Printing to traditional Silver Gelatin and the Historical Wet Plate Collodion process, he believes that the hands on aspects of working in the darkroom and using a large format camera give the artist a real sense of creation over their work.

In 2008 during my second year at RISD, the school had decided to get rid of their color photography program. They felt that with the trend of photo-labs closing down, they didn¡¯t see the purpose in teaching students a medium that would discontinue. They ended up giving me the equipment, I set up a color darkroom in the basement of a mill building. I began making experimental C-Prints and working with Wet Plate Collodion. I feel that working in the darkroom is magical and meditative.
Your photography feels like¡­
Vision, camera movements lead the view into the image with the softness felt by our own eyes. Skin becomes metallic, and the slow nature of working in the darkroom takes on a meditative quality. The portraits are of friends and couples, who sit for me. They are not meant to be over the top images, I seek a simple intimacy in the photographs. I aim for the images to take on the same meditative state that the process offers me in the darkroom, a simple beauty, a quiet intimacy.

cate-dingley-chicago-il-usa

I began making photos at 14, using the camera to communicate as I was so shy I rarely spoke to anyone. I have been shooting constantly since, mostly teaching myself, bringing my cameras with me to upstate New York, where I attended college, Paris, where I assisted a photojournalist, and now Chicago, where I currently live and work.
You shoot film because¡­
I use photography to purge something from myself, a process necessary to my everyday life, and film is a means to that end. It does not feel like photography without the sharp smell of chemicals, the hours spent alone in patient anticipation, and the feel of a wet print in my hands, the satisfying, tangible end result.
Your photography feels like¡­

I have been doing photography for 10 years. I studied photography at Kyungil University in Korea and at Dawson College in Canada.
You shoot film because¡­
I love film photography because I can create my own way of making images in a darkroom. Therefore, I have photographed with Paper Negative, X-ray, Polaroid, 35mm, 120mm, and 4¡Á5 film. As well, I created a unique way of developing films for my personal projects: Rorschach and Soul series.
Your photography feels like¡­
My photography is a journey of which I have been looking for who I am, so this series, Lifeless Portrait, is one of my journeys. One day, I thought that I might have been able to take out souls from bodies by using photography. Based on this idea, I began this series, moody.

We moved back to the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island, where I was born and raised. We are now residents of Sungoma Arts Center, near the city of Duncan, where we are surrounded by trees, mountains, lakes, fields, and talented, creative pals.
You shoot film because¡­
It feels ¡°more real¡± to me. I prefer to capture/create an image rather than manipulate pixels. I could never get into digital photography. I don¡¯t want to use a computer to take a photo. I will never understand the appeal of taking dozens of shots of the same subject, and then choosing the ¡°best¡± one, or whatever it is people do. It¡¯s just something about film that makes me feel warm and comforted as opposed to the cold, sterile feeling I get from digital photographs. But that¡¯s just me.
Your photography feels like¡­
Memories. They have a way of fading and becoming distorted over time. There is something magical and mysterious about a film photograph, perhaps it¡¯s the grain, the haze, the focus, the colours, the flaws, the wait between taking a shot and getting results. Film has ¡°warmth¡±, it has ¡°soul¡±. It has emotion. Something about the way light interacts with film that lets me feel something more in line with what I remember of a time and place than could ever be captured by digital sensors.

My work as an artist/photographer features the world around us viewed in an alternative way.
You shoot film because¡­
I prefer the comparative slowness of the process and the greater degree of control over and care of the subject matter within the image making process. The subject requires greater thought in the process for me when I use film as it is wasteful to ¡°snap¡± at things. Then the anticipation of the final image after processing is a further pleasure and adds to the creative process. Additionally when I am creating some of my large abstract pieces i will make a sketch of the subject first.
Your photography feels like¡­
It is an emotional process for me as I am drawn to the subject, sometimes over a period of days, weeks or months, a bit like flirting, before committing myself to creating the image. It is almost like falling in love! An amazing and exhilarating feeling.

I shoot with a 4¡Á5 field camera because I work with architecture and it allows me to perfect my images in ways that most digital cameras can not. I enjoy the experience of looking at the ground glass and composing an image. I appreciate the time it takes me to setup and think about the perfect position, height, and distance I should make the image at. Finally, I shoot film for the quality. I feel that my work needs to be printed large, and 4¡Á5 film allows me to go larger than digital capture.
Your photography feels like¡­

I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 2012, I graduated from Sheffield Hallam University with a BA (Hons) in Fine Art. As the only child of a stained glass artist and a geologist, I spent my childhood acquiring a love for art and a taste for travelling. Moving from country to country has given me many fortunate experiences, and photography has helped me to document these over the years. I have always felt compelled to capture the various fragments of my life, my evolving desires.
You shoot film because¡­
I liken the entire photographic process, from start to finish, to an erotic encounter. The careful handling of the heavy camera, opening her up, inserting the delicate film. The tangible, tactile nature of each action, each stage. Even the sound the shutter makes reminds me of the sound of bedclothes falling to the ground¡­ This closeness I feel towards the inanimate camera is mirrored by the eroticization of objects which I have developed as my subject matter.

Shooting on film demands a certain level of concentration and encourages me to slow down in my working practice, in contrast to the high volume and quick turn around of images expected from me at work. After using digital at work on a daily basis experimenting with film challenges my creativity and ability as a photographer. Medium format (120 film) particularly interests me as I find the symmetry of square format aesthetically pleasing.

You shoot film because¡­
I shoot film because I like the feelings of excitement and curiosity you have before having your negative developed, it¡¯s not like digital photography where you can immediately see what you¡¯ve done. You need to wait, to be patient and so there¡¯s something that grows inside you. I personally love to spend time in my darkroom, I love to see the picture that appears in the photographic paper. The analog photography makes me feel proud of myself, of what I¡¯m doing, makes me feel creative.
Your photography feels like¡­
I like pictures that transmit something, for example personal feelings. In my photography there is always a little bit of melancholy and idyllic sense. If I had to draw analogies with something I would probably mention music by Chelsea Wolfe and Godspeed You Black Emperor.

Though more connected by ever-expanding technological means, there seems to be a growing disconnect ¨C between each other and between action and consequence. While our brave new cyber world has many benefits, I have found that it adds countless distractions and lessens the depth of experiences. For me, film is one way to make experiences more tangible and to more fully connect with the medium of photography. I believe that this comes through in my images and speaks to the viewer.

Short bio¡­
My name is Gerrit Hahn. I am a 33 yo portrait photographer. I am interested in the personal stories of people, their lives and what they consist of. I worked as a freelance photographer for 8 years now and lived in Berlin for the last 12 years. After working as an assistant for 3 years after I came to Berlin I started working for magazines and advertising. Realising that the most important part for me about my work is the people I happen to get to know I started working more with video lately.

When I took my first pictures it was on film and it didn¡¯t take much time from that moment to find myself in my own darkroom. Developing and printing was an important part of the whole photographic process. The standard and industrial processes may have changed, the most important part for an intimate portrait is how I approach a situation as a photographer. And that did not change. I have to let go control in some regards, and the best way for me to do so is to trust in what I am able to do.

For me it feels like I am back in the situation a photograph was taken. Perfect. It is a very deep sensation in many cases. Also I am listening to music a lot when I work and music inspires me a lot, so for me there is music in my pictures as well. I heard several times that people found my photography cinematographic and in some cases I see the point though there was never an intention behind that.

You shoot film because¡­
With my ADHD mind, film forces me to concentrate and really look at the subject while with my digital camera it¡¯s really easy to just keep shooting without really taking the time. It¡¯s a different way of working. I love analog grain and I also like the fact that it can be as unpredictable if you want it to be.
Your photography feels like¡­
My photography consists of my own memories of things that happened, and of the memories and scenes I¡¯ve created myself. I have to have people around me at all times, that¡¯s why I almost only take photos of people. I¡¯m bad at being alone, although I am intrigued by the idea of loneliness.

I was born in Hawaii, but moved several times back and forth across the U.S. After pursuing a degree in literature, I returned eventually to photography, having been the begrudging assistant to my father, a wildlife photographer, for the whole of my childhood. I currently live in Los Angeles, which is a remarkable homebase for a landscape photographer. The west of the United States has a whole planet¡¯s worth of diversity.
You shoot film because¡­
The pace, mechanics, and ritual of shooting film are a critical part of my experience when I¡¯m taking pictures. I¡¯m primarily a landscape photographer, and to encounter a place and decide how to treat it is my most favorite thing. Shooting film slows me down so that I¡¯m forced to look at the character of a place, rather than just the moment.

For my personal work and research, I mostly turn to a silver film camera. I like to see accidents emerge on the film roll, I also like to provoke them but also to discover them once I have my film developed. Then something happens, and it¡¯s vital to me.

I¡¯m shooting film because I¡¯m falling in love with the Rolleiflex and the way to shoot from the belly. The film photography has more nuances and looks deeper and warmer than digital. With a film camera, you need to take time to photograph. For me, time is a real need to capture what I feel.

You shoot film because¡­
I¡¯m shooting film to bring more depth and sensitivity into the portrait. As the process of shooting film is slower, it allows me to really look deeper into the person¡¯s natures. Shooting film I really involved into filming, without getting distracted by the intermediate results. All that together with color depth and more expressive contrast helps me to stay photographer, rather than becoming designer in Photoshop.

I shoot film because of the slow, personal, and creative process it allows the photographer to have. There¡¯s something special about taking my time with the 4¡åx5¡å view camera, getting the structure of the image correct in my ground glass, taking the photo, and then waiting until it¡¯s processed to see the final result.

I am 28 years old. I¡¯ve been shooting film for about 4 years. I am not a professional and taking photos mainly as inspiration. Photography for me is a self expression, the way to reveal what is happening inside of me, something that can not be put into words.
You shoot film because¡­
A film camera tends to stop and reflect, to catch the right moment and condition. It helps me to stay in the moment. I pause, adjust the camera, look into viewfinder and see a miracle. And I never know what will happen at the end.

The rich colors and the process is what captivates me. There is no rushing in film there is just waiting for the right moment to capture. It¡¯s what defines my work and speaks to me unlike any other thing in this world. It takes me to a place far away where things were slower, meaningful and timeless. To me, film photography is real art.

I am a documentary photographer from England. I am passionate about people and their stories, particularly stories of the under represented and different approaches to well-known subjects.

Chrystal Lea Nause grew up in a small farming community outside of Chebanse, Illinois. Her father instilled in her an adventurous spirit and a love for travel. In 1997, she traveled to Tasmania where she began to make photographs and developed a case of wanderlust that has yet to be quenched. In 2005, Chrystal received her Bachelor of Arts Degrees from SIUC (Photography, Criminal Justice). She received a Master of Arts degree in 2010 from the Department of Anthropology at SIUC.
You shoot film because¡­
I prefer traditional processes that incorporate light-sensitive materials and chemistry to match the nostalgic ¡°feel¡± that my photography evokes. Many have suggested that my images are reminiscent of pre-1940s photography and cinema. I also love the process of photographing with large format cameras: they force me to slow down and help me to focus on composition, the play of light, and the decisive moment at which to expose each sheet of film. I also love to play in the darkroom.
Your photography feels like¡­

Her work has been extensively exhibited and published both in the UK and internationally, and her first monograph, Dreamlands / Wastelands will be published by Jane&Jeremy in summer 2013.
You shoot film because¡­
The main thing I love about film is that each picture is like a little present ¨C a surprise. You never quite know how it will turn out. When I shoot Polaroid, even the smallest change in light can have a huge difference, and the temperature of where I shoot, or how I ¡°nurse¡± the picture while developing can all cause massive changes. With expired film, the picture is only half yours, and the rest belongs to fate. I like the physicality of it and room for experimentation. I embrace failures!
Your photography feels like¡­
My photography feels like a warm breeze on your face on a summers day, or a cold biting wind that cuts you to the bone. It¡¯s visceral, poetic and dreamlike. It¡¯s imperfect and evocative. My Polaroids fall into two categories ¨C ¡°straight¡± Polaroids (unedited, unmanipulated on expired film), or emulsion lifts (shown here). Photography should be about evoking a reaction, and my emulsion lifts are like dream sequences, linking unrelated places and memories. They are nostalgic, delicate, and flawed.

I am a Toronto-born photographer who currently resides in Montreal. I attended Humber College where I did my studies in creative photography. Since my graduation, my work has been featured in many exhibitions and publications on an international level and I have been fortunate enough to have collaborated with many different artists working in a wide variety of mediums. In 2011, I released my first book, titled ¡®ghost¡¯, and have since switched over from digital to all analogue based means.
You shoot film because¡­
The mystery and the wonder that lays behind shooting analogue is one that is rewarding. The act of shooting something (regardless of whether or not you have an actual ¡®plan¡¯) and not having any idea of what exactly it is you¡¯ll see after development. Film is a constant learning process. Analogue does not give you the instant results which today¡¯s technologies do ¨C it reminds us that time exists and sometimes we must wait for or work for a desirable end product.

Distorted dreams. A dystopia. Somewhere in between the true and false, the real or imagined.

You shoot film because¡­
I¡¯m still using film and darkroom not just because I love and want to preserve the medium, but because anticipation is inherent in the analog film process. The latent image that exists on the unprocessed film, and the wait in the darkroom for the image to appear are natural extensions of the theme of anticipation in my work. The monochrome palette furthers the idea of a glimpse into possibility by reduction to shapes and symbols.

I grew up on a farm in the rural town of Bronson, MI, where there are probably more animals than people and only two working traffic lights. I moved to the East Coast for college, fell in love with the city of Boston, and graduated from Harvard with a BA in Visual & Environmental Studies. I currently live in Rochester, NY, which I¡¯ve learned is actually the arctic, judging by its cruel weather. This is my final year of graduate school at RIT, a campus full of hipsters and engineers.
You shoot film because¡­
I like the way in which film shapes my personal approach to photography, how it causes me to carefully consider each frame, knowing I only have 12. It slows me down, needs my full attention, and forces me to really focus on that moment, not worried yet about what comes next. That uncertainty of whether I got the shot or not, pushes me to work harder. I relish in the magic of discovery when the film is processed. For me, film is real, it¡¯s tangible, it¡¯s something to treasure and go back to.
Your photography feels like¡­
My photography feels like those little glimpses from out of the corner of your eye, where a moment, probably unremarkable to most, makes you pause and really look, mentally cataloguing it away to puzzle over later, or to savor in the days when it¡¯s long gone.

You shoot film because¡­
To create images on film requires real presence; something tangible must exist in front of the camera for the picture to be made. Film photography requires chemistry for the alchemic cycle to be completed and for the image to be fixed permanently on the substrate. Yet, even with all of this absoluteness, the photographs themselves are shifting interpretations¨C fragments that form beautiful works of fiction. What remains for us to see is a beautiful paradox¨C a quantum reflection of vision.
Your photography feels like...
A strive for balance. A need for reflection and meditation. An obsession for questions without answers. A desire to distill the vastness of the world before me into finely crafted sentences. Poetry.

I take photos with a film as it is a magical process. Digital camera is too easy to use. This advantage turns into a serious disadvantage. You just start taking too many pictures. You stop thinking. Quality loses its value, turning simply into quantity. The Bresson key moment is lost. UNIQUENESS of every picture is lost as well. It happens spontaneously, but it is a fact. When you put a film in your camera and you know that there are only 12 shots, you have to value each shot.

I am a graduate of Ryerson University School of image arts (2011). My current photographic work consists of large-scale collages of gelatin-silver prints produced from multiple 4¡Á5 negatives and finished in Beeswax. Unframed and tangible, the exhibition of my artwork challenges the prevailing convention of a photographic image being a single flat surface exhibited within a frame.
You shoot film because¡­
In my work I use analogue techniques such as double and triple exposures as well as photograms to create fragmented images that are both real and fantastical. The beautiful tonal range and the weight of gelatin-silver paper accompanied with the extreme detail that is achieved when using a 4¡Á5 camera are a central part of my creative process. These techniques and qualities show the enduring value of analogue in contemporary photography.

Photography on film is tangible, it exists. The idea of a photograph as an object existing on the film and later as a print, is important to me. The process of using film makes me more aware .

I depend on the slowness of processing my photographs; developing from moments in the present to a story that takes on a life of its own, physically and emotionally.

Short bio¡­
Photography is Chuck¡¯s third career the result of a passion acquired in Maine many years ago. Becoming full time in 2008 changed the work in profound ways. Previously, the work showed people anonymously and was more about the public space. In this new time, the work has become intensely personal ¨C often involving portraiture. This can be seen in The Album Project, Precious Objects, Costumes and, still in progress, Lustron Stories. Even Every Place ¨C I Have Eve

I want the people in my projects to be participants, not subjects. The wooden camera makes the process much less technical, slower and more awkward. Exposures are long requiring the people in the picture to consciously hold still. In the end, it serves to ameliorate the power difference between them and and me.
Your photography feels like¡­
i want the viewer to see themselves in the experience of the people in my photographs. Then to ask questions about those things, ethical, historical and political. Again, it is no the film so much as the less technical and more interesting process.

Plauchut Virginie was born in 1976. She began self-taught photography in 2009. Over time, the themes become clearer. Her approach is more narrative, the human is omnipresent, visible or not. Since 2011 she has developed a work or photography and writing meet and revolve around notions of intimacy, introspection, loneliness or even closed. Each series is a narrative dimension, Virginie tells us and tells stories.

Your photography feels like¡­
In this work, I discuss the absence of the child who is no longer one. It is then more narrative or autobiography but individual plots made ??available and who speaks more than one thing: change, transition: the definition of a before and an after, a time that you want to suspend, something intangible, the intimacy of a memory. The images were taken with a Fuji Instax. This choice reflects the desire for a form of letting go but also the difficulty of a clear statement of feelings.

You shoot film because¡­
Shooting film is the only way I have found to create an accurate depiction of the concepts I want to portray. Film photography sits between reality and representation, not quite aligning with but still representing the real. It adds a beautiful mystery to the process of taking photographs, with the creation of the image and the existence of its physical manifestation separated by time. There is nothing quite like great art; its magic is demonstrated and preserved by film photography.
Your photography feels like¡­
A combination between Irving Penn and Arnaud Maggs, but feminized. A less clinical Rineke Djikstra. Dutch Golden Age paintings, made photographic. I derive inspiration from so many aspects of life that my art is a convoluted version of everything I engage with. Dreams, memory, and my never-ending fascination with beauty all play a role in my art creation. At its best, my photography feels like an intimate moment through my eyes, a representation of how I conceptualize the world.

Fort Worth Texas is where I was born, raised and continue to live with my wife and daughter. It was my great fortune in life to be born into an artistic family. My dad was an artist and professor of art and my mom was quite accomplished in multiple mediums as well. Though I studied Architecture in school I don¡¯t make my living by it. It does, however, often guide me in terms of subject matter. The natural world is my other primary focus. Of course there¡¯s my daughter, but that¡¯s different.
You shoot film because¡­
Film¡¯s ¡°limitations¡± are important to me. They require thought, patience and a freaking clue as to what you/it are doing. Working with film is, for want of another word, meditative. It¡¯s slow-er. The more ¡°organic¡± look of a film photograph is also very important to how I like my work to look. The Luddite in me likes having a physical negative, rather than just a ¡°file¡± of 0s and 1s.

Short bio¡­
Born and raised in Budapest, I did my university studies in Barcelona, Tel Aviv and London, where I am based now. Throughout my artistic practice, my main interest has been the psychological landscape of the urban life from a human and architectural point of view. I begin by observing and photographing my environment. I make videos, sound recordings, architectural models and then start to speculate on their possible changes. ?But the process?always starts with photography.
You shoot film because¡­ I like everything about it more; the sound how the camera shoots, the smell of the film, the aesthetics of the cameras, changing the film, the guy in the shop where I develop my films¡­.. and of course the texture of the resultant images.

You shoot film because¡­
I like the whole process of analog photography. I like the smell and the noise and knowing there is a limit of photos in one roll makes me carefully consider each frame. To focus what I want to photograph. It is really sharpening my flair of the composition of photography.

Quote of a good friend Eva Sophie: ¡°With his contemporary photographs he captures moods of light and shadow. Places of silence and darkness are revealed through the light of the lens. Simplicity, solitude, and melancholy calmly refer to the contrary of the fast life. The photos are special in terms of composition, harmonious colors and interesting appearance. The photos look at ease and unconstrained, and enable a glimpse of the world through his eyes.¡±.

Honestly, because I¡¯m lazy. Film does half of my job, providing picture that can¡¯t be achieved with any digital camera ¨C especially when I¡¯m shooting with my Hasselblad 501CM. And it also makes me more concentrated on what I¡¯m about to do before pressing the shutter. And what can compare to browsing at a film store, it¡¯s like a candy shop on Sunday!

I love to think of it as of a thread that leads you from reality into a dream making you discover things you¡¯d never thought about. But I don¡¯t stick to any particular style in general ¨C I love to experiment with visual approaches and techniques, choosing the right one for the concept at hand.

I am a Scottish artist working with lens-based media, principally as an analogue photographer concentrating on wet-plate collodion and film technology and as a filmmaker combining digital video and hand-developed 8mm and 16mm film-stock. I trained at the Glasgow School of Art then fled the country, returning after a dutiful spell in London and a more relaxed time in Amsterdam; I now live in Edinburgh. My work is rooted in place and the intrinsic connections between people, land and sea.
You shoot film because¡­
I always have. I was taken into the darkrooms at the Glasgow School of Art by my tutor in 1988. I have hand developed film and printed since then. It is part of my armoury as an artist.The work I have sent you is wet plate work, part of McArthur¡¯s Store documentary project, a three year project (now in its second year) documenting the fishing community in Dunbar, a small town on the Eastern seaboard of Scotland. The project is being made using wet plate collodion, pinhole, 120 and 35mm film.
Your photography feels like¡­
The McArthur¡¯s Store is a building from 1658 inhabited only by fishermen; wet plate collodion was originally chosen to compliment the film. There is an archive of early photography in Scotland recording the fishing industry: collodion has a way with peoples eyes and I decided not to record the men in action but to catch them being still, to use portraiture to slow them down, to quieten the noise of the harbour. Also, these tintypes were made within McArthur¡¯s Store, in their environment.

Julie¡¯s work has been exhibited both nationally and internationally; her most recent exhibitions include Hyde Park Arts Center¡¯s Ground Floor Exhibition and Margate Photo Fest 3.
You shoot film because¡­
The most important to me as an artist about film is its materiality. Not only am I working with a machine that is capable of record whatever is in front of the lens, but I am also granted the opportunity to work with this wonderful complex and diverse light-sensitive material. In my work I push film¡¯s inherent range to its limits, working in a space that lends for the materiality of the medium itself to create the surreal within reality and challenge expectations of what a photograph does.
Your photography feels like¡­
My work feels like magic realism unfolding in the monotony of Midwestern American suburbia. I draw inspiration from the films of David Lynch and John Carpenter and their focus on the absurd and horrific set against the safety of the suburbs. The photographs I make heavily reference dreams and/or memories and are taken directly from my own personal childhood experiences. I am interested in the way memory recollection is distorted and the surreal quality they take on as we grow older.

I started taking pictures with my Vivitar 110 of my friends in the neighborhood. When I was 14, one of my photographs was selected to tour the state in a 4-H Club traveling exhibit. In college I only took one photography class, and spent many years as a skilled beginner. Last year I had the opportunity to go back to school where I am focusing on visual arts. Last semester I began making self portraits which developed into a theme which expanded across all of my classes.
You shoot film because¡­
I have always enjoys film and the suspense in waiting for film to be developed. Several years ago I started collecting vintage and antique cameras which turned into more of a rescue project. I seek out all formats of film, cameras and darkroom equipment in order to preserve the medium. I believe that the skills and passion that one puts into creating an image using any of the analog techniques gives the piece an aura that digital can only duplicate.

Short bio¡­
Born 1990 in Cambridge, UK. Studied for a BA (hons) in Documentary Photography at the University of Wales, Newport. 2009-12. Shooting mainly in the UK and Germany. My work has been included in publications and group shows in the U.K and Holland. My first solo exhibition will be held in Milan in March 2013. I have also self published 2 books. Currently I am working on personal projects, commissions and exhibitions prior to applying for an MFA.
You shoot film because¡­
It provides me with a physical connection to the medium, allowing for the control of subtleties that I appreciate, therefore the darkroom is integral to my working processes. I mainly work in black and white, as I value it¡¯s reductive abilities, and the manner in which it enables me to use light as a tool whilst shooting and printing. I firmly believe that using film, (especially larger formats with a technical camera), gives me the ability to express my ideas and interests most fluently.
Your photography feels like¡­
To me it feels like an intense studying, where an object has been isolated and changed (or elevated), allowing it to speak for more than itself. What appears in the images is determined by both ideas and aesthetics, so I aim for the objects in my photographs to be read like excerpts from a text. In this way I could say it is analogous to literature or poetry, working at night is therefore a device used to transform the subject, so it can express feelings and ideas I help to determine.

You shoot film because¡­
I have been working with film since my first days in photography and it is a medium I am most confident with. In my projects I often photograph everyday and ordinary things that require my mind and eyes to work constantly, looking for something unapparent but valuable enough to become an image. It enforced a certain patience and, therefore, film photography, which requires much more deliberate decisions, for me is the most appropriate way of working.

I work in all mediums. I choose the process I work in for how it marries to the idea I am trying to express. The body of work Point of Origin is emotive and filled with memory. I use an 8¡Á10 view camera because it slows me down and creates an image that feels grounded and present. I use film for my b&w work because digital images feel very different¡­ cold and processed. This work is about my family. Touching, embracing and sometimes fighting with prints while in the act of making them just feels right.

You shoot film because¡­

You shoot film because¡­
From the first moment of photography, I started to shoot in film. To me, film shooting is more about photography itself. Every proccess of film shooting makes me contemplate sincerely about my photography. It¡¯s more innate and natural to me. I¡¯m more comfortable with the speed and results of film shooting.
Your photography feels like¡­
My photography is like short writing or poem about space and time in between me and my object. I feel like to create one map about my theme. Every images are pieces of big puzzle. I quest and sniff in exploring my photographing behavior. I am very excited and wondered to encounter the last scene of my project as an accomplished map. It¡¯s more like everyday life¡¯s journal. Journal can be humble and banal. But it can be history with accumulation of time.
